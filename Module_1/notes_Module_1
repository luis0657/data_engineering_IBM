Introduction to Data Engineering


The value we derive from data depens on: (In a nutshell, the job of a data engineer)
1. Accuracy of data
2. Accessibility of data when we need it


Key Players in the data Ecosystem

Data engineers: Data architectures
Data Analysts

Data Scientist

Business Analysts


Modern data ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and continually evolving entities that include:

Data, that is available in a host of different formats, structures, and sources. 

Enterprise Data Environment, in which raw data is staged so it can be organized, cleaned, and optimized for use by end-users.

End-users, such as business stakeholders, analysts, and programmers who consume data for various purposes.

Emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, and Big Data, are continually reshaping the data ecosystem and the possibilities it offers.

Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts, all play a vital role in the ecosystem for deriving insights and business results from data.

The goal of Data Engineering is to make quality data available for analytics and decision-making. And it does this by collecting raw source data, processing data so it becomes usable, storing data, and making quality data available to users securely.
